# 311-l-system
2010 MDDN 311 Final Project (2014 fix)


### Description ###
This was a learning project in 2010 for an introductory computer graphics class (MDDN 311).  
This was when I was first introduced to computer programming and procedural generation. 
This class may have changed since then. This project is kept for historical purposes. 

Using Maya, the script draws 3D objects using an L-system. 

I am unable to find the original 2010 reference material used to guide elements of the script. 
If I recollect correctly, the guide project drew the objects in 2D and I expanded it to 3D. 
I also had assistance from tutors and the professor. 


### 2014 Edits ###

Previous 2010 version had incorrectly calculated the vector direction. 
After taking COMP308 (Introduction to Computer Graphics) in 2014, I corrected the calculation.
In 2014 the script was checked using Maya. Some 2010 sections are commented out for reference. 
In 2023 the vector was verified again using a Blender equivalent script but not the rest of the script. 


### Possible changes ###

I may do a full blender conversion of this script as Maya is not a justifiable expense for the frequency of these kinds of personal projects.
